# MyVisualBasicProjects
Here are the Windows applications I developed while in Xth standard. These were not something from my Syllabus. I just created them own my own, for fun.\
We were taught just basics of VB in class. During following Summer Vacations, I decided to learn more online and practice. And here are the results!
## 1. BMI Calculator
